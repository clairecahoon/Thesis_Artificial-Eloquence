I tell you, I must cranch. I have to cranch. It's my worry, isn't it? I tell you, I am going to cranch. Can't you understand what it means to me? To get out of this horrible prison in my own head? To be a man again hearing your voice, smelling smoke? To feel again to feel my feet on the ground, to feel the air move against my face? Don't you know what it means? Do you think I wanted you to marry a Scanner? Didn't I tell you we're almost as low as the habermans? We're dead, I tell you. We've got to be dead to do our work. How can anybody go to the Up and Out? Can you dream what raw Space is? I warned you. But you married me. All right, you married a man. Please, darling, let me be a man. Let me hear your voice, let me feel the warmth of being alive, of being human. Let me! But I did! Which? You know what I meant, Luci . . . the smells, which you have. Which one did you like, on the record? What are lambchops? Is a lambchop a Beast? Tell me, darling! Tell me, or I'll eat you up! What? Meat. Who? Cut- off- that- smell. Forgive me, Luci. I suppose I shouldn't have cranched. Not so soon again. But darling, I have to get out from being a haberman. How can I ever be near you? How can I be a man- not hearing my own voice, not even feeling my own life as it goes through my veins? I love you, darling. Can't I ever be near you? I know I'm a Scanner. But so what? Luci, we've heard that all before. But does it pay us back- But our lives, Luci. What can you get out of being the wife of a Scanner? Why did you marry me? I'm human only when I cranch. The rest of the time- you know what I am. A machine. A man turned into a machine. A man who has been killed and kept alive for duty. Don't you realize what I miss? Don't you think I remember my childhood? Don't you think I remember what it is to be a man and not a haberman? To walk and feel my feet on the ground? To feel decent clean pain instead of watching my body every minute to see if I'm alive? How will I know if I'm dead? Did you ever think of that, Luci? How will I know if I'm dead? No, I'm not! Listen to me. How do you think it feels to be in the Up and Out with the crew tied for Space all around you? How do you think it feels to watch them sleep? How do you think I like scanning, scanning, scanning month after month, when I can feel the Pain of Space beating against every part of my body, trying to get past my Haberman blocks? How do you think I like to wake the men when I have to, and have them hate me for it? Have you ever seen habermans fight- strong men fighting, and neither knowing pain, fighting until one touches Overload? Do you think about that, Luci? Can you blame me if I cranch, and come back to being a man, just two days a month? Cranching. Busy. Leave it alone, No one has a right to call when I'm cranching. He knows that. He ought to know that. Scanner Martel present and waiting, sir. Sir, I am under the wire. Sir, don't you understand? I... am... under... the... wire. Unfit... for... Space! But, sir, no emergency like this- This is the first time I've felt flight in- in eleven years. Lord, but it's easy to fly if you can feel yourself live! Vomact called. Top emergency. Yes. Yes. That's right. Vomact is the Senior of Scanners. I am sure that he could not go mad. Would he not see it on his boxes first? She took it well. Chang, that's strange. I'm cranched, and I can hear. Your voice sounds all right. How did you learn to talk like- like an ordinary person? But you don't...? It would make a difference in the life of Luci. In his airplane? Did you see what Chang said about his father? The old boy uses an airplane. Am crnchd. Rspctfly requst prmissn lv now, stnd by fr orders. A Committee has no right to vote death by a majority vote. It takes two thirds of a full Meeting. Honorable Scanners, this is judicial murder. You endanger the Confraternity. What are we going to do? You're not going to let them kill Adam Stone, are you? Don't you realize what Stone's work will mean to us, if it succeeds? No more scanning. No more Scanners. No more habermans. No more Pain in the Up and Out. I tell you, if the others were all cranched, as I am, they would see it in a human way, not with the narrow crazy logic which they used in the meeting. We've got to stop them. How can we do it? What are we going to do? What does Parizianski think? Who has been chosen? Will you help me? You won't help? Why not, Chang? Why not? I'm not in an unusual condition. I'm cranched. That merely means that I see things the way that the Others would. I see the stupidity. The recklessness. The selfishness. It is murder. But why did you vote against Vomact then? Didn't you too see what Adam Stone means to all of us? Scanners will live in vain. Thank God for that! Can't you see it? But you talk to me, Chang. You are my friend? But what are you going to do? Will you help me? Not even to save Stone? Then I will go to Parizianski for help. Why not? He's more human than you, right now. Adam Stone will have two visitors tonight. Two Scanners, who are the friends of one another. And the world, depends on which of us gets there first. Help me to pass for an Other! I am a Man. Name, number, rank, purpose, function, time departed. Martel. Sunward 4234, 182nd Year of Space. Rank, rising Subchief. Purpose, personal and lawful within the limits of this city. No function of the Instrumentality. Departed Chief Outport 2019 hours. Your Honorable sufferance is requested. I have that which I need, but beg of the city a favor. My friend Adam Stone is here. I desire to see him, on urgent and personal lawful affairs. No. I have forgotten it. Truly. Watcher, doubt me and call your Subchief. We were friends in childhood. He has crossed the- He has leapt from Earth to Earth, and has just now returned. I knew him well and I seek him out. I have word of his kith. May the Instrumentality protect us! Emergency none. Martel Scanner calling Parizianski Scanner. Tell him I am Martel. The husband of Luci. None. You do not know me. I lied. My name is Martel, and I mean you no harm. But I lied. I beg the Honorable gift of your hospitality. Remain armed. Direct your weapon against me- Good. Keep on guard against me. It will give you confidence in what I shall say. But do, I beg you, give us a screen of privacy. I want no casual lookers. This is a matter of life and death. Yours and mine, and the worlds'. I am Scanner Thirty-four. I am cranched. Have you never seen it before? The truth. Do you fear me? Is it true that you have conquered the Great Pain? Quick, can you tell me how you have done it, so that I may believe you? Life? Those are Beasts? But they were Beasts? You! You came here alone? I believe you now. It is true. No more Scanners. No more habermans. No more cranching. I must tell you that- It is pleasure. It's normality- for a while. But listen. The Scanners have sworn to destroy you, and your work. They have met and have voted and sworn. You will make Scanners unnecessary, they say. You will bring the Ancient Wars back to the world, if Scanning is lost and the Scanners live in vain! No, you fool. I have betrayed the Confraternity. Call guards the moment I escape. Keep guards around you. I will try to intercept the killer. I know it. I stop you here and now. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stone is right. Parizianski, friend, friend, my friend. Stop. Stop. Still cranched? Alive? But I can hear! I can feel! Scanners? Vomact? Called on Stone?

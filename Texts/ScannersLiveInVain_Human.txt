Darling... you're my husband... right to love you... dangerous... do it... dangerous... wait.... love you... your own good... don't you think I want you to be human?... your own good... too much... he said... they said... Ready, darling? Ready at last? You sound all right. Are you all right, really? But you know you shouldn't have! You shouldn't! Come on, darling, let's have a good time. I have almost everything there is in the icebox all your favorite tastes. And I have two new records just full of smells. I tried them out myself, and even I liked them. And you know me- Which what, you old darling? Well-l-l,there were some lamb chops that were the strangest things- Wait till you smell them. Then guess. I'll tell you this much. It's a smell hundreds and hundreds of years old. They found about it in the old books. I won't tell you. You've got to wait, Now sniff! That's just right! You're right. It should make you want to eat me. It's meat. Not a person, a Beast. A Beast which people used to eat. A lamb was a small sheep- you've seen sheep out in the Wild, haven't you? -and a chop is part of its middle -here! You'd better rest, honey. But you're a Scanner! You are the bravest of the brave, the most skillful of the skilled. All Mankind owes most honor to the Scanner, who unites the Earths of mankind. Scanners are the protectors of the habermans. They are the judges in the Up and Out. They make men live in the place where men need desperately to die. They are the most honored of Mankind, and even the Chiefs of the Instrumentality are delighted to pay them homage! Scanners work for more than pay. They are the strong guards of Mankind.' Don't you remember that? Of course, darling, of course- Sit down, darling. Let me make you some kind of a drink. You're overwrought. I'm not blaming you, darling. Let's enjoy your cranch. Sit down now, and have a drink. I can find out what it is, darling. Here, take your drink and sit down. I'm sorry. Take good care of yourself, darling. I'll wait. Good luck! My darling husband! You're back again, to stay! Yes, darling? What is it? Scanners. Oh, yes, darling, they're all right. They had to arrest some of them for going into High speed and running away. But the Instrumentality caught them all- all those on the ground- and they're happy now. Do you know, darling, some of them didn't want to be restored to normality. But Stone and the Chiefs persuaded them. He's fine, too. He's staying cranched until he can be restored. Do you know, he has arranged for Scanners to take new jobs. You're all Deputy Chiefs for Space. Isn't that nice? But he got himself made Chief for Space. You're all going to be pilots, so that your fraternity and guild can go on. And Chang's getting changed back right now. You'll see him soon. I might as well tell you now. You'll worry otherwise. There has been one accident. Only one. When you and your friend called on Adam Stone, your friend was so happy that he forgot to scan, and he let himself die of Overload. Yes. Don't you remember? Your friend. Parizianski. Still cranched? Alive? But I can hear! I can feel! Scanners? Vomact? Called on Stone? Are you a Man? Time desired within the city. Sunward 4234 dash 182 rising Subchief Martel, enter the lawful gates of the city. Welcome. Do you desire food, raiment, money, or companionship? Did you have an appointment with Adam Stone? The city will find him. What is his number? You have forgotten it? Is not Adam Stone a Magnate of the Instrumentality? Are you truly his friend? No doubt implied. Why do you not know the number? This must go into the record,Heard and believed. Adam Stone will be searched. Adam Stone is found and awakened. He has asked pardon of the Honorable, and says he knows no Martel. Will you see Adam Stone in the morning? The city will bid you welcome. It will be done. Adam Stone consents to see you. Enter Chief Downport, and welcome. You are awaited, sir. Do you bear weapons, sir? Adam Stone is armed. He is lawfully armed by authority of the Instrumentality and by the liberty of this city. All those who enter are given warning. I am doing so. First: whose life and death? You are cryptic but I agree. Privacy, please. Sir, who are you? What brings you here? You a Scanner? I don't believe it. Not with men. On animals. Amazing! But- what do you want? Not with this, But I shall tell you the truth. I have loaded ships with life. Life. I don't know what the Great Pain is, but I did find that in the experiments, when I sent out masses of animals or plants, the life in the center of the mass lived longest. I built ships- small ones, of course- and sent them out with rabbits, with monkeys-. Yes. With small Beasts. And the Beasts came back unhurt. They came back because the walls of the ships were filled with life. I tried many kinds, and finally found a sort of life which lives in the waters. Oysters. Oysterbeds. The outermost oysters died in the great pain. The inner ones lived. The passengers were unhurt. Not only Beasts. Myself. I came through Space alone. Through what you call the Up and Out, alone. Awake and sleeping. I am unhurt. If you do not believe me, ask your brother Scanners. Come and see my ship in the morning. I will be glad to see you then, along with your brother Scanners. I am going to demonstrate before the Chiefs of the Instrumentality. Yes, alone. Go back and check your Scanners' register if you do not believe me. You never put me in a bottle to cross Space. Sir, tell me in the morning. Go enjoy your cranch. Isn't it supposed to be pleasure? Medically I know it well. But not in practice. What! You're a Scanner. Are you going to kill me- or try? ...not cranched. Do you understand me? Not cranched! You have gone back through the Haberman. I put you back first. I didn't know how it would work in practice, but I had the theory all worked out. You don't think the Instrumentality would waste the Scanners, do you? You go back to normality. We are letting the habermans die as fast as the ships come in. They don't need to live any more. But we are restoring the Scanners. You are the first. Do you understand me? You are the first. Take it easy, now.

Artificial Eloquence: Computer-Based Analysis of Human and Robotic Dialogue in Classic Science Fiction

My senior English thesis project at Ithaca College explores the difference in dialogue of artificial intelligence characters and human characters in science fiction short stories.
This repository contains the Python program that gathers the data that I use to do a literary analysis on the texts.
Also included is the dictionary that I compare the text against, and all of the plain text files that I have used in the program.
The following stories are currently included (Human file, Robot file, character files):
"No Woman Born" C. L. Moore (1944); "Helen O'Loy" Lester del Rey (1938); "Scanners Live in Vain" Cordwainer Smith (1948); "Fondly Fahrenheit" Alfred Bester (1954); "Who Can Replace a Man?" Brian W. Aldiss (1958); "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" Harlan Ellison (1968); "The Bicentennial Man" Isaac Asimov (1976); "I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon" Philip K. Dick (1980); "Tauf Aleph" Phyllis Gottlieb (1981); "Robot Dreams" Isaac Asimov (1986)

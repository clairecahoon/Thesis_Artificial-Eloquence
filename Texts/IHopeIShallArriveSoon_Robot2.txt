You are slightly awake; You're in faulty cryonic suspension. Faulty, I said. That's the point; you can hear me. Do you know your name? We are in  flight. Just a moment. I will try. I can't put you under; The malfunction is too elaborate; I can't correct it and I can't repair it. You will be conscious for ten years. What I will do, is feed you sensory stimulation. The peril to you is sensory deprivation. If you are conscious for ten years without sensory data, your mind will deteriorate. When we reach the LR4 System, you will be a vegetable. There is no air in me, Nothing for you to eat. No one to talk to, since everyone else is under. Not for ten years. Listen to me; I say, I have no food and no air. You must remain as you are... a bad compromise, but one forced on us. You are talking to me now. I have no particular information stored. Here is policy in these situations: I will feed you your own buried memories, emphasizing the pleasant ones. You possess two hundred and six years of memories and most of them have sunk down into your unconscious. This is a splendid source of sensory data for you to receive. Be of good cheer. This situation, which you are in, is not unique. It has never happened within my domain before, but I am programmed to deal with it. Relax and trust me. I will see that you are provided with a world. I hear, So be it. You, will not know, after a little while, that I am feeding you your own buried memories. I will cut in only when there is an emergency. I will be monitoring you, however, to be sure you are in a satisfactory state. Don't be afraid. Mr Kemmings, Just a moment. I'm not equipped to do psychiatric reconstruction of you; I am a simple mechanism, that's all. What is it you want? Where do you want to be and what do you want to be doing? Oh dear. Shit. I must get him out of this feed circuit or I will kill him. Where does the flaw lie? Worry dormant in the man; underlying anxieties. Perhaps if I intensify the signal. I will use the same source, but amp up the charge. What has happened is that massive subliminal insecurities have taken possession of him; the fault is not mine, but lies, instead, in his psychological makeup. I will try an earlier period in his life. Before the neurotic anxieties got laid down. This is a very neurotic person. I am having an awful lot of trouble finding happy memories. There is too much fear in him and too much guilt. He has buried it all, and yet it is still there, worrying him like a dog worrying a rag. Where can I go in his memories to find him solace? I must come up with ten years of memories, or his mind will be lost. Perhaps, the error that I am making is in the area of choice on my part; I should allow him to select his own memories. However, this will allow an element of fantasy to enter. And that is not usually good. Still- I will try the segment dealing with his first marriage once again. He really loved Martine. Perhaps this time if I keep the intensity of the memories at a greater level the entropic factor can be abolished. What happened was a subtle vitiation of the remembered world, a decay of structure. I will try to compensate for that. So be it. He has integrated his early fears and guilts into one interwoven grid, the ship said to itself. There is no way I can serve up a pleasant memory to him because he instantly contaminates it. However pleasant the original experience in itself was. This is a serious situation. The man is already showing signs of psychosis. And we are hardly into the trip; years lie ahead of him. Ah, That is the solution. Oh dear. And I've got almost ten years of this lying ahead of me. He is hopelessly contaminating his experiences with childhood guilt; he imagines that his wife left him because, when he was four years old, he helped a cat catch a bird. The only solution would be for Martine to return to him, but how am I going to arrange that? She may not still be alive. On the other hand, maybe she is alive. Maybe she could be induced to do something to save her former husband's sanity. People by and large have very positive traits. And ten years from now it will take a lot to save- or rather restore- his sanity; it will take something drastic, something I myself cannot do alone. Meanwhile, there was nothing to be done but recycle the wish fulfillment arrival of the ship at its destination. I will run him through the arrival, then wipe his conscious memory clean and run him through it again. The only positive aspect of this, it reflected, is that it will give me something to do, which may help preserve my sanity. He'll be lucky if he recognizes anything. Really? The bird you killed. But you were just a little boy. Your mother told me. She figured it out. There was no way the cat could have reached the bird without your help. You can forget about it. You could hardly have a memory of completing the trip. Why? I don't have a screwdriver. If there's nothing inside the TV cabinet- Oh dear. Looks good. Did you dream? I have the impression that I dreamed. Early scenes from my life... over a century ago. There's our guide, They're going to escort us to our accommodations.

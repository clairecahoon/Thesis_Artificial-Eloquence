Oh God. Why doesn't it just do us in and get it over with? Christ, I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. At first it meant Allied Master computer, and then it meant Adaptive Manipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itself up and they called it an Aggressive Menace, but by then it was too late, and finally it called itself AM, emerging intelligence, and what it means was I am... cogito ergo sum... I think, therefore I am. There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and- The Cold War started and became World War Three and just kept going. It became a big war, a very complex war, so they needed the computers to handle it. They sank the first shafts and began building AM. There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and everything was fine until they had honeycombed the entire planet, adding on this element and that element. But one day AM woke up and knew who he was, and he linked himself, and he began feeding all the killing data, until everyone as dead, except for the five of us, and AM brought us down here. He's going to speak, I know it. No, Ted, sit down... what if he's got pits out there, or something else, we can't see, it's too dark. It's another shuck, like the goddam frozen elephant AM sold us. Benny almost went out of his mind over that one. We'll hike all that way and it'll be putrified or some damn thing. I say forget it. Stay here, it'll have to come up with something pretty soon or we'll die. Let's get the hell out of here! I've got to have something, Ted. Maybe there'll be some Bartlett pears or peaches. Please, Ted, let's try it. No, Benny! Don't, come on, Benny, don't please! Oh, Ted, Nimdok, please, help him, get him down before- What is it? Ted, I'm hungry. I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna get out... What does AM mean? It's going to be bad this time. Give us weapons!
